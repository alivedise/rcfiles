        - fix to quiet Perl::Critic::Compatibility 

0.07  Mon Jul  7 23:11:47 EDT 2008
        - tests of Expect interface seem to sometimes time out too
	  early, so increase test timeout from 10 to 30 seconds.  

0.06  Fri Mar 21 18:06:50 EDT 2008
        - require Perl 5.8.0 or higher.  Changes to make this

        - DiffsOnly option to envs returned the inverse of what
	  it was supposed to.

0.04  Fri Sep 21 11:29:07 EDT 2007
        - add support for dash
	- Interactive mode is no longer the default due to bad
	  interactions with dash, which is the default /bin/sh on
	  some systems.

0.03  Thu Sep 20 13:34:35 EDT 2007
        - use Storable to save/retrieve %ENV; avoid eval's and extra
	  YAML module
	- use wrapper script to clean up sub-shell command to save %ENV
	- add timeouts to tests to prevent possible infinite hangs

0.02  Sun Sep 16 22:19:48 EDT 2007
